            <h3>Falcon 9</h3>
            <img src="img/falcon-99.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The Falcon Heavy is one of the most powerful and impressive rockets from SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk. It is capable of carrying heavy payloads into orbit, with the ability to send large satellites, space probes, and even crewed missions to destinations beyond low Earth orbit. With its significant payload capacity, it's one of the most notable reusable rockets and has been pivotal in expanding the horizons of space exploration, offering a more cost-effective way to send large payloads into space. Its structure consists of three Falcon 9 rocket cores, making it one of the most potent operational rockets currently available.</p>

            <h3>Falcon Heavy</h3>
            <img src="img/heavy.png" alt="">
            <p>The Falcon Heavy is one of SpaceX's most powerful and impressive rockets. It's an enhanced version of the Falcon 9, consisting of three main Falcon 9 cores, providing a significantly increased payload capacity.</p>

                <p>Capable of carrying massive payloads into Earth's orbit, the Falcon Heavy is designed for missions that require considerable lifting capability. Its versatility allows it to transport a variety of payloads, from large commercial satellites to space probes destined for farther locations.</p>
                
                <p>One of Falcon Heavy's most notable features is its reusability. Similar to the Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy's stages are designed to return to Earth after launch, making them reusable for future missions. This reusability has been instrumental in reducing the costs associated with space launches</p>

                <p>The Falcon Heavy has significantly expanded SpaceX's payload capabilities, opening doors for more ambitious missions such as deep space exploration, transporting large payloads into orbit, and even the potential for crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit.</p>
                
                <p>Its impressive payload capacity, combined with stage reusability, has made Falcon Heavy an attractive option for a variety of commercial, scientific, and governmental space missions, playing a crucial role in advancing exploration and reducing costs associated with space launches.</p>
